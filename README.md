Introduction to Scientific Computing (ENGS 20) is course that introduces students to programming in C++ and MATLAB and the foundations of scientific computing.  USING MATLAB, this module has students learning to use numerical solvers of ODE and systems of ODE to address questions about a model of the relationship between glucose and insulin in humans. Student use published data to fit parameters of a model and make predictions with the numerical solutions.  The module covers data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, and drawing conclusions.

### Folder Structure
The folder *completed_module* contains all of the module components.  

The *components* subfolder contians two subfolders with a first short assignment and a second long assignment.

the *data* subfolder contains a csv file with all the published data for the module as well as single text files with only the insulin and glucose data.

The *logistics* folder contains the instructor guide for the module.
