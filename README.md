Introduction to Scientific Computing (ENGS 20) is a course that introduces students to programming in C and MATLAB as well as the foundations of scientific computing. This module is focussed on the MATLAB portion of the class. USING MATLAB, in this module students address questions about a model of the relationship between glucose and insulin in humans. To do so, students explore the use of numerical solvers for ODE and systems of ODE, both by coding Euler’s method ‘by hand’ as well as by using built-in solvers. Students use published data to fit parameters of a model and make predictions with the numerical solutions. The module covers data science areas of analyzing data, visualizing data, and drawing conclusions.

### Folder Structure
The folder *completed_module* contains all of the module components.  

The *components* subfolder contains two subfolders, one containing a short assignment to be completed by students as a way to introduce the topic and a second containing a more involved long assignment that accomplishes the module objectives.

The *data* subfolder contains a csv file with all the published data for the module as well as single text files with only the insulin and glucose data.

The *logistics* folder contains the instructor guide for the module.
