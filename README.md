# Module Overview
## Module Objective 
Student gain experience with using a numerical solver for a differential equations model coupled with parameter estimation based on a experimental data set.

## Student Learning Objectives
1. Establish a basic understanding of ODEs and MATLAB functionalities
2. Use a differential equation model of a real-world system to practice analysis of graphical behaviors in relation to equations.
4. Apply the Least-Squares Method to optimize one parameter in the model for a given set of data
5. Calculate additional parameters and compare these to acceptable values

## Module Description
Using MATLAB, in this module students address questions about a model of the relationship between glucose and insulin in humans. To do so, students explore the use of numerical solvers for ODE and systems of ODE, both by coding Euler’s method ‘by hand’ as well as by using built-in solvers. Students use published data to fit parameters of a model and make predictions with the numerical solutions. The final “long” coding assignment for ENGS 20 had traditionally been an investigation of the solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the use of Euler’s method, analytical solutions, and ODE solvers in MATLAB. However, Professor Bonfert-Taylor recognized that this assignment often lacked the context of a real-world application when only the ODEs were provided for students to solve through various methods. She was interested in finding an ODE or a system of ODEs describing a real interaction that could be modeled by students along with data to provide inputs for and then validate the model.

She found resources from papers investigating the response of the human insulin system to glucose and proposed that the DIFUSE team develop a new long assignment in which students apply a simplified ODE model of this system. She also proposed a shorter coding assignment to be completed before the long assignment that introduces students to the concepts of ODEs and to coding Euler’s method.

### Data
This module using glucose and insulin level data taken from a published experiment.

### Platform
The module uses MATLAB live scripts.

## Course Information

This module was developed for an Engineering course, <a href="http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Engineering-Sciences/ENGS-Engineering-Sciences-Undergraduate/ENGS-20">Introduction to Scientific Computing</a>, which introduces students to programming in C and MATLAB as well as the foundations of scientific computing.  Students are not assumed to have any programming experience at the outset, but learn both platforms leading up to the module.
